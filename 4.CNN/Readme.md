# CNN 

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and its PDF version that demonstrate the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for predicting handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset. The notebook also showcases the process of saving and restoring TensorFlow models.

## Table of Contents

- [Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN and Model Saving/Restoring](./HandwrittenDigitRecognition_CNN_SavingRestoring.ipynb): This notebook combines two topics. Firstly, it showcases the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for predicting handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset. The notebook covers the architecture, training, and evaluation of the CNN models, utilizing various layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Secondly, it demonstrates the process of saving trained TensorFlow models and restoring them for later use. It covers various methods and techniques for saving and loading models, allowing you to reuse pre-trained models or continue training from a saved checkpoint. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have TensorFlow and its dependencies installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the CNN folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the notebook "HandwrittenDigitRecognition_CNN_SavingRestoring.ipynb," and run the cells sequentially. The notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the implementation of the CNN models and the process of saving and restoring TensorFlow models.

The PDF version of the notebook can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different architectures, or explore additional applications of CNNs for image recognition tasks.
