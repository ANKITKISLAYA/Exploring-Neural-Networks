# CNN

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and its PDF version that demonstrate the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for predicting handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Table of Contents

- [Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN](./HandwrittenDigitRecognition_CNN.ipynb): This notebook showcases the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for predicting handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset. The notebook covers the architecture, training, and evaluation of the CNN models, utilizing various layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have TensorFlow and its dependencies installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the CNN folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the notebook "HandwrittenDigitRecognition_CNN.ipynb," and run the cells sequentially. The notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the implementation of the CNN models for handwritten digit recognition.

The PDF version of the notebook can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different architectures, or explore additional applications of CNNs for image recognition tasks.
