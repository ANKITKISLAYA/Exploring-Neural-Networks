# Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and its PDF version that demonstrate the implementation of Multilayer Neural Networks with ReLU activation function using TensorFlow. The notebook also showcases the process of saving and restoring TensorFlow models. The models are applied to predict handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Table of Contents

- [Multilayer Neural Networks with ReLU and Saving/Restoring Models](./MultilayerNN_ReLU_SavingRestoring.ipynb): This notebook combines two topics. Firstly, it demonstrates the implementation of Multilayer Neural Networks with ReLU activation function using TensorFlow. It includes the training and evaluation of the models for predicting handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset. Secondly, it showcases the process of saving trained TensorFlow models and restoring them for later use. It covers various methods and techniques for saving and loading models, allowing you to reuse pre-trained models or continue training from a saved checkpoint. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have TensorFlow and its dependencies installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the Deep Learning folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the notebook "MultilayerNN_ReLU_SavingRestoring.ipynb," and run the cells sequentially. The notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the implementation of the models and the process of saving and restoring TensorFlow models.

The PDF version of the notebook can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different architectures, or explore additional applications of deep learning with TensorFlow.
