# Neural Network Basics

This folder contains Jupyter Notebook examples for building and understanding fundamental concepts of neural networks. The notebooks cover topics such as perceptrons, softmax, gradient descent, and multilayer perceptrons.

## Table of Contents

- [Perceptron](./Perceptron.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates the implementation and working of a perceptron, which is a basic building block of neural networks. It showcases the binary classification capability of a perceptron using a simple linear model.
- [Softmax](./Softmax.ipynb): Explore the softmax function, a commonly used activation function in neural networks for multi-class classification problems. The notebook illustrates how softmax normalizes the output to produce class probabilities.
- [Gradient Descent](./GradientDescent.ipynb): Learn about gradient descent, an optimization algorithm widely used for training neural networks. This notebook demonstrates how gradient descent updates weights to minimize the loss function.
- [Multilayer Perceptron](./MultilayerPerceptron.ipynb): Dive into the concept of a multilayer perceptron, which extends the single-layer perceptron to handle more complex problems. The notebook illustrates the architecture, forward propagation, and backpropagation in a multilayer perceptron.

## Usage

To run these notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the Neural Network Basics folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the desired notebook, and run the cells sequentially. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the concepts and implementations.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, or add your own variations to deepen your understanding of neural networks.
