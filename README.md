# Exploring-Neural-Networks

This repository contains a collection of conceptual projects and code examples related to neural networks. Each folder in this repository focuses on a specific topic and contains projects that were completed during my learning journey of neural networks, inspired by the Udacity Deep Learning Course.

## Table of Contents

- [NeuralNetworkBasics](./NeuralNetworkBasics): This folder includes introductory materials and basic implementations of neural networks.
- [TensorFlow](./TensorFlow): Explore projects related to TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.
- [Deep_Learning](./Deep_Learning): Discover projects that delve deeper into various aspects of deep learning.
- [CNN](./CNN): This folder contains projects specifically related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for image recognition tasks.
- [Keras](./Keras): Explore projects that utilize Keras, a high-level neural networks library.
- [TransferLearning](./TransferLearning): Learn about transfer learning, a technique where pre-trained models are used as a starting point for new tasks.

## Usage

Each folder contains separate projects and code examples. Navigate to the respective folder to access the code and project files related to that topic. Within each folder, you will find detailed documentation and instructions on how to run the projects. Feel free to explore the projects, modify the code, and use them as a reference for your own learning and development.
