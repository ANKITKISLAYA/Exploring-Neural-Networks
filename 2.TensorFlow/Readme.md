# TensorFlow Examples and Handwritten Digit Recognition

This folder contains Jupyter Notebook examples and their PDF versions that demonstrate basic usage of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. Additionally, it includes a Jupyter Notebook that applies deep neural networks using TensorFlow to predict handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Table of Contents

- [Basic TensorFlow Examples]: This notebook provides simple and basic examples of using TensorFlow. It covers topics such as tensor operations, building and training simple models, and utilizing predefined TensorFlow functions and APIs. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.
- [Handwritten Digit Recognition]: In this notebook, deep neural networks are implemented using TensorFlow to predict handwritten images of digits in the MNIST dataset. It showcases the training and evaluation of various models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feedforward neural networks (FNNs), for accurate digit classification. The PDF version of the notebook is also provided.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, make sure you have TensorFlow and its dependencies installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the TensorFlow folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the desired notebook, and run the cells sequentially.
