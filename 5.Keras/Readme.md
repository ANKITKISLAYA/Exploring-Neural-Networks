Certainly! Here's a README file for the Keras folder in your repository:

# Keras Basics: Traffic Dataset

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and its PDF version that demonstrate the basics of Keras using the Traffic dataset. The notebook provides an introduction to Keras, a high-level deep learning library, and showcases its usage on the Traffic dataset.

## Table of Contents

- [Keras Basics on Traffic Dataset](./KerasBasics_TrafficDataset.ipynb): This notebook introduces the basics of Keras, covering topics such as model building, compiling, training, and evaluation. The Traffic dataset is used as an example to demonstrate the application of Keras. The notebook includes loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, defining the model architecture, compiling the model, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have Keras, TensorFlow, and their dependencies installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the Keras folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the notebook "KerasBasics_TrafficDataset.ipynb," and run the cells sequentially. The notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the basics of Keras and its application on the Traffic dataset.

The PDF version of the notebook can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different models, or explore additional datasets and applications with Keras.
