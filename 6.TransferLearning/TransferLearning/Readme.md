# Transfer Learning with AlexNet

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook and its PDF version that demonstrate the concept of transfer learning in neural networks using AlexNet. The notebook utilizes pre-trained weights of AlexNet, which were trained on the ImageNet dataset, to classify test images.

## Resources

To run the notebook successfully, you will need to download the pre-trained weights of AlexNet. The weights can be found at the following link: [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/).

Please download the weights and save them in the Transfer Learning folder before running the notebook.

## Table of Contents

- [Transfer Learning with AlexNet](./TransferLearning_AlexNet.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates the concept of transfer learning in neural networks using AlexNet. It showcases how to utilize the pre-trained weights of AlexNet to classify test images. The notebook covers loading the pre-trained weights, adapting the model for the specific task, and evaluating its performance on the test images. The PDF version of the notebook is also available for reference.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, and other required libraries. Clone this repository and navigate to the Transfer Learning folder. Download the pre-trained weights of AlexNet from the provided link and save them in the same folder. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line, open the notebook "TransferLearning_AlexNet.ipynb," and run the cells sequentially. The notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and comments to guide you through the transfer learning process using AlexNet.

The PDF version of the notebook can be accessed for a quick overview of the code and concepts covered.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different architectures, or explore additional transfer learning scenarios using different pre-trained models and datasets.
